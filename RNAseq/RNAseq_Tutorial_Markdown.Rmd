This is the documentation for the RNAseq tutorial, all in one place. 
First things first, this is meant for you to be able to run with minimal assistance, 
but if you need assistance, let me know. 

Each section of code will have a little play button to run that section individually. 
There is also an option on the top of this screen saying "run" with a green arrow. You 
can run the whole document with the options in that, should you choose. 

Each step will have a lot of documentation as well as where you need to add your own 
information so that it runs correctly.
